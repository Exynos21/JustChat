A Messaging Service App - JustChat
JustChat is a real-time messaging application that allows users to communicate seamlessly through text messages, images, and files. Built with modern web technologies like React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend, the application offers a clean and intuitive user experience.
The primary features include user registration and authentication, one-on-one messaging, group chats, real-time message updates via Socket.io, and additional features like file sharing and emoji support. The backend uses REST APIs to handle data exchange between the client and the server, while MongoDB serves as the database to store user details, messages, and other related data.
The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, enabling future expansion with additional features such as an AI-powered chatbot and video/audio calling.
